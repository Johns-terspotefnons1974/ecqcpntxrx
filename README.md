OMG, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Marked Men and I gotta say, I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. The visuals were, like, stunning! Seriously, every shot felt like a painting. But you know what? The story... eh, kinda all over the place? 😂 Like, who thought smashing those plot points together was a good idea?

And the characters, okay, I liked some of them, don’t get me wrong. But they’re all like “let’s make emotional decisions without any logic.” Reminded me of that time we tried to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and ended up with a completely different 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮. Remember that? Good times. At least the soundtrack was dope, got me bopping even during the slow parts.

> And I don't even know where to start with the dialogue. Some lines were seriously poetic and others... sounded like they were pulled from a chat bot, I'm not kidding. It’s like, are these people even talking to each other for real? It’s like they’re in separate  s or something.

But anyway, the lighting though! I mean, you know I’m a sucker for good lighting and this was just chef's kiss. Made me wanna grab my camera and start shooting something, like, right now, even though I’m dead tired. Oh! I almost forgot that chase scene! Had me on the edge, no joke. Almost makes me wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just for that. Almost.

Why am I talking about the set design? The coffee must be wearing off. But yeah, def recommend 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it for the visuals alone—mind-blowing! If it could talk, it’d say “look at me, I’m what happens when you overthink but make it pretty.”

Python code incoming for no reason: 
```python
for i in range(10): print(Why am I doing this?)
```
Oops, lol... brain fizzled for a sec, must be sleepy rambling. But yeah, dude, give it a go if you're down for some eye candy and don’t mind a bit of a plot mess. Shoot me your thoughts after you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it and let me know if I’m losing my mind over here or what.
